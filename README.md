# LightBox

## Setup on Local Machine

1. Ensure the latest version of NodeJS is installed on your machine: [Node Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Open a CLI (Command Prompt or Git Bash) and `cd` to a location for light-box download
3. Enter the command: `git clone git@github.com:Rainh2001/light-box.git` or if that doesn't work, use: `git clone https://github.com/Rainh2001/light-box.git`
4. Once complete, `cd` into the light-box directory: `cd light-box` and run the command: `npm run setup`
5. NPM (Node Package Manager) should begin installing the required dependencies and then a react development server will startup and open a browser tab for you
6. You're now good to go! :D
